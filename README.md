# Autograding Server for Intro to CS Bootcamp

New autograding server for Intro to CS Bootcamp (built with Django 3.0.2 as the main backend framework). Migrating from the older Ruby on Rails framework for more efficient, stream-lined processing, better library support for analytics insights. Older framework will still remain in use, but only serving as backend for the course website.

### Current Status: Under Development

## Completed:
- [x] Set up Django Server Rest Framework
- [x] Set up Routing

- [x] Set up User Authentication and Sign Up (including associated front-end pages)
- [x] Set up Autograding Framework using Temporary File Caching and Subprocesses
- [x] Set up POST-related CSRF Protection for Form Submission

## In Progress:
- [ ] Migrate Dev Database to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Integrate the Rest of Existing Test Cases for All Assignments into the Framework
- [ ] Deploy Autograding Server and Complete Routing with Original Website
- [ ] (Potentially) Integrate Google Authentication
- [ ] (Potentially) Switch from Embedded Python HTML files to React.js
